# Drivebay

Password-locked file browser for every drive on this machine. Built to run inside [Pinokio](https://pinokio.computer).

**Install this URL in Pinokio:**

```
https://github.com/lordstryfe/drivebay-pinokio
```

Current version: **3.19** — see [Changelog](#changelog) below.

## Install in Pinokio (do this)

1. Delete any old Drivebay folders first. In File Explorer delete these if they exist:

   - `Z:\pinokio\api\drivebay.git`
   - `Z:\pinokio\api\drivebay`

2. Open **Pinokio**.
3. Go to **Discover** (or **Download from URL**).
4. Paste `https://github.com/lordstryfe/drivebay-pinokio` and download.
5. Click **Install**. Choose **Static** (you pick the port) or **Random** (new port each Start).
6. If you chose Static, forward **that same port** on your router.
7. Click **Start**, then **Open Drivebay**.
8. The first visit creates the **only** username and password. Pick something strong — Pinokio is already visible online, and this app can see every file on the machine.
9. After that, anyone who opens it can only unlock. Nobody else can sign up.
10. In the sidebar, open **X:**, **Z:**, and any other drives you want.

Change the port later with **Set port** or the in-app **Settings** page, then Start again.

## Install without Pinokio

Download **Drivebay-Setup-3.19.exe** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lordstryfe/drivebay-pinokio/releases). You do not need Node.js, git, or Pinokio. The installer includes the server and the runtime that runs it, and it starts a production build.

Push a version tag such as `v3.19` to publish that file on the release. Pull requests also upload the installer as a build artifact.

The setup screens are:

1. **Welcome.** The runtime is included.
2. **Folder.** Where to put the program. This is a per-user install.
3. **Mode.** **Tailscale** (over your tailnet, no router change) or **Regular** (this network, which needs a router port forward).
4. **Port.** Required in both modes. A free port from 1024 to 65535. The suggested port is 42013.
5. **Router** (Regular only). You have to open and forward **that port** on your router. The page shows the port you picked. You must check the box to continue. Tailscale skips this page. Allow the same port in Windows Firewall if Windows asks.
6. **Tailscale** (only if you chose Tailscale). Other devices on your tailnet open `http://<this-pc-tailscale-name>:<port>/` after you sign in to Tailscale on both devices. You can download the official installer from `pkgs.tailscale.com` and launch Tailscale. You do not forward the port on your router.
7. **Password.** The only username and password (at least 8 characters). Drivebay opens in the browser so you can sign in. If that account cannot be saved, setup shows the reason and writes the same text to the install log. The login page then lets you set the lock on first run. A reinstall does not replace an existing password.
8. **Shortcuts.** Start menu entries (Drivebay, Stop Drivebay, and Uninstall) are always created. They open a notification-area icon, not a console window. Optional desktop shortcut. Optional **Start Drivebay when I sign in to Windows**, which starts that same icon in the background.
9. **Finish.** Opens Drivebay in the browser. The icon stays while the server is running. Double-click it, or choose **Open Drivebay**, to open the page. The right-click menu can also copy the Tailscale or LAN address, start, stop, or restart the server, open the logs folder, turn **Start with Windows** on or off, or quit. A short notice appears when the server comes up. If the server stops on its own, the icon changes so you can see it.

The password lock is unchanged: drives stay behind that login. Uninstall stops the tray icon and the server, removes the program, shortcuts, and the startup entry, and asks before deleting the saved password.

Tailscale and public addresses use the same plain-HTTP sign-in rules Pinokio already uses, so the login form works from a tailnet address. That does not turn the lock off.

Your username and password are stored in a `data` folder next to the app. **Update does not delete them.**

Search: type in the search box and press Enter (or Ctrl/Cmd+K). It looks through the current folder and its subfolders. Hidden folders follow the eye toggle.

## After it is running

- Browse folders, preview images and text, upload, new folder, rename, delete.
- Click **Lock** when you walk away.
- Open **Settings** for password, port, version, and feature requests.
- Use **Update** in Pinokio if this repo changes.

## Safety

Treat the password like a house key. Do not share the Pinokio link and the password together. The first person to open a fresh install owns the lock — make sure that person is you.

## Changelog

### 3.19
- Installer text is plain ASCII, so mode choices no longer show a broken em dash.
- The password page accepts two matching passwords and rejects a mismatch, a short password, or an empty one.
- Tailscale mode skips the router port-forward notice. Regular mode still requires it. Both modes still pick a local port.

### 3.18
- Windows installer that does not need Pinokio, Node.js, or git.
- Setup: Tailscale or regular, a free port, router-forward notice for that port, and the account password.
- Optional official Tailscale install, Start menu, desktop shortcut, uninstaller, and start with Windows.

Versions 3.15–3.17 are in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### 3.14
- Search walks **subfolders**.
- Hidden folders (names starting with `.`) are included when the eye is on.
- Toggling the eye re-runs the current search.

### 3.13
- Opens on **Home** instead of Workspace.
- Settings shows the version number.
- **Request a feature** in Settings opens a GitHub issue.

### 3.12
- Home page no longer loads the big file-browser module on the server (fixes Windows 500).
- **Update** now force-resets to GitHub `main` so new code actually arrives.

### 3.11
- Removed leftover file-list code that crashed the home page (500).

### 3.10
- Fixed a typo in `vite.config.ts` that blocked **Start**.

### 3.9
- Stopped a Windows database crash from showing a JSON 500 page.

### 3.8
- **Search this folder** (Enter or Ctrl/Cmd+K).

### 3.7
- **Settings** page (password + port).
- Login lock stored in a `data` folder so **Update does not wipe it**.

### 3.6
- Install / Set port asks **Random** or **Static**.

### 3.5
- Installer can pick a **static port** for router forwarding.

### 3.4
- Login works from a public / Tailscale / phone address (invalid origin fix).

### 3.3 and earlier
- Pinokio install package, X: and Z: drives, password lock, file browser.
